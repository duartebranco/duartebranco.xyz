            "A vibrant digital painting exploring the intersection of natural beauty and digital aesthetics.",
        fullDescription:
            "Digital Sunset represents my exploration of how traditional landscape painting techniques can be translated into the digital medium. Using custom brushes and layering techniques, I aimed to capture the ephemeral quality of light during golden hour while incorporating geometric elements that speak to our digital age.
